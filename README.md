# Timeline
AS2 & AS3 CPPS Emulator, written in Python.
Timeline is built heavily on Twisted and is even-driven, most of the methods are Deferred too!

## AS2 and AS3 Cross-Compatibility
**The flexibility of Timeline, makes sure it's cross-compatible with both AS2 and AS3 clients.** 

From the version 6 of Timeline, Timeline can run both AS2 and AS3 Servers at once. One solution for multiple problems. AS2 is integrated into the AS3 Piece of pie, with some tweaks and added extra flavors. *No loss of performance, experience, and stability has been made during this compatibility upgrade. It indeed works better than ever before*. Timeline v6 is ready for production too.

*For convenience, here, we refer both Timeline AS2 and AS3 as Timeline.*

*Note: There maybe many other plugins not listed in the above list, the above are ones officially tested and found to be working and 100% legit*

# Installation and Usage
Download **Timeline**, put it in an accessible and readable directory. Navigate to that directory using CMD or Shell or any console client. Run `Start.py`. The server will start running.

You can edit `Start.py` to change `Handlers` module scope, `TCP` IP/Port endpoints, Logger etc. You can also add new methods!

Make sure you run **MySQL** and **Redis** server before starting the server.

You can query/run **database.sql** to build tables in your db.

# Default
* Default **database**          : **times-cp**
* Default **user**              : *username:* **test**, *password:* **password**
* Default **crumbs** directory  : **./configs/crumbs/**

**IMPORTANT :** 
    By default Timeline uses colored logger, so you must install _'colorlog'_. If you wish not to use it and go by classical logger, change the following line
```py
TimelineLogger = InitiateColorLogger()
```
to
```py
TimelineLogger = InitiateLogger()
```
